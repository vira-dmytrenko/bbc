# Read and do this before doing anything else!

### How to view this course

You can view it in Git itself. If you download it locally, IntelliJ IDEA has fully functional Markdown viewer. 
Simply checkout this project from Git, open the containing folder as Project in IDEA, then select "Preview only" in the top right corner to see only contents and not editor for MD files.

### List of files that you will need to complete tasks

- [Getting_Started.md](Getting_Started.md) - read and do this first.
- [Troubleshooting.md](Troubleshooting.md) - contains solutions to a few very common problems. Look here first if you are stuck.
- Variant files in one of the variant folders in Tasks/Variants. You only need one variant, though you can do more than one. See note below. Pick a variant before doing any tasks.
- Task files: you do these in sequence. Task 1 and Task 2 use Part 1 and Part 2 of your variant.
	- [Task 1](./Tasks/Task1.md)
	- [Task 2](./Tasks/Task2.md)
	- [Task 3](./Tasks/Task3.md)
	- [Task 4](./Tasks/Task4.md)
	- [Task 5](./Tasks/Task5.md)

- HowTo folder contains instructions on how to install SpecFlow (for Task 4) and how to upload to GitHub (to be able to show your work on Lab interview).

### Important note on variants

Lorem Ipsum is the easy variant.
BBC1 is the average variant.
BBC2 is the difficult variant. 

It's recommended to pick the easy or average variant to start with (depending on your confidence), and pick a harder variant for Task 5.
